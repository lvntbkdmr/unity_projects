# What I Have Learned

* Creating UI elements (Button, Image)
* UI Anchor points (fixing relative positions of the UI elements relative to the screen resolution)
* Different Sceens with different buttons
* Button click -> link with an empty game object which has a public method, so onClick() event triggers that public method inside game object's relative c# script
* SceneManager.LoadScene() 
* Try to Strect anchor points of texts inside buttons
* Use UI Image element as backgrounds
